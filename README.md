## üìÅ .gitignore ‚Äî Extended Description

This `.gitignore` file is tailored for a hybrid repository that blends **code, research, and documentation**. It‚Äôs designed for long-term evolution across multiple formats‚Äîincluding Markdown documents, Python scripts, data tables, and visualizations.

**This file excludes:**
- Python cache files (`__pycache__`, `.pyc`, `.pyo`, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook checkpoints
- Temporary or backup files from editors like Vim, Emacs, VS Code
- Operating system-specific clutter (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
- Auto-saved Markdown or documentation drafts
- Environment folders (`.env`, `.venv/`) for future Python execution

This ensures a clean, portable versioning experience where only meaningful source content is tracked.
