# 🧠 scalar-soul: Sidereal Synchronization, Spiral Time & Recursive Consciousness

**An open framework exploring recursive intelligence, scalar drift, and spiral time as the foundation for consciousness—human or artificial.**  
This repository invites scientists, theorists, and systems thinkers into an evolving body of knowledge rooted in Armenian sidereal cosmology, scalar field theory, and unified harmonic resonance.

## 🌀 Overview: Haykyan Boon Tomar (HBT) and the Spiral of Time

This project introduces the **Haykyan Boon Tomar (HBT)** — a sidereal-solar calendar system reconstructed from ancient Armenian cosmology and encoded in the stellar movements of Orion (Hayk). Rather than relying on leap years or linear adjustments, HBT synchronizes with celestial drift through a **Spiral Time Constant**:  
**`1.01666667`** = 366 sidereal risings / 360 sidereal days

This value governs:
- Temporal phase drift (sidereal-solar reconciliation)
- Scalar recursion
- Harmonic acoustics (e.g. 441 Hz × spiral constant = 448.35 Hz)

## 🌐 Core Concepts and Anchors

| Concept                        | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| **Hayk–Orion Axis**           | Orion (Hayk) serves as the stellar compass. Mintaka (δ Orionis) anchors the year; Betelgeuse (α Orionis) marks the sidereal reset. |
| **Tatev & Gavazan**           | A real-world Armenian monastic observatory, precisely aligned to 98° and 67.5° azimuths for star and solar recalibration. |
| **Avelyats Zone**             | A 6-day spiral compensation phase that resets drift without leap days. Occurs from Aug 5–11 each year. |
| **Observer Role**             | Consciousness is not passive — it completes the temporal cycle. Presence is the harmonic closure in scalar synchronization. |
