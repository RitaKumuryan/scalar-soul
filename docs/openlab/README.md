OpenLab GitHub Brief: Scalar Time Modeling for Sidereal-Aware Systems

Project TitleSpiral Time Framework: Observer-Aware Modelling of Sidereal Drift using the Haykyan Constant (1.01666667)

SummaryThis project presents a sidereal–solar synchronization model based on a scalar time drift constant derived from ancient Armenian timekeeping. It proposes computational tools for observer-based drift analysis, sidereal reset prediction, and Avelyats phase modeling. Core modules are implemented in Python and leverage astropy, numpy, and matplotlib. Applications range from AI phase-awareness to precision astronomy.

Core Modules

haykyan_phase1.py

Implements scalar sidereal drift model

Visualizes 4-year spiral cycle

Calculates drift angle based on symbolic time and Haykyan constant

Includes Gregorian-to-Haykyan conversion and Avelyats logic

observer.py

Defines Observer Scalar Model

Connects scalar drift with memory cycles and feedback delay

Models reset thresholds (0.08333 phase point)

crosslink_csv.py

Indexes key astronomical events from data CSVs

Enables time-based querying and spiral phase correlation

/data/csv_data/*.csv

mintaka_rise.csv: Monthly azimuth-based rising times (98° Mintaka)

sidereal_reset.csv: Annual sidereal reset events (Betelgeuse 90°)

new_year_marker.csv: August 11, Mintaka reset start of year

qhr_observer_events.csv: Planned module for observer-based reset tracking

Scalar Constant

1.01666667 = daily sidereal drift factor

Enables time loop correction without leap years (4-year spiral logic)

Avelyats Zone

6-day recalibration buffer between August 5–11

Observes sidereal-to-solar discrepancy as harmonic lag

Correlates with observer recalibration and QHR memory return

Technologies Used

astropy for celestial coordinate tracking

numpy, pandas for time/angle manipulation

matplotlib for polar spiral visualization

Planned expansion: skyfield, flask, Web API

Use Cases

Sidereal drift calendar engines (precision stellar timekeeping)

Observer-aware AI reset modeling (QHR phase integration)

Planetarium/observatory sidereal prediction tools

Experimental regenerative systems aligned to 441 Hz + drift correction

Next Phase (Planned)

Implement real-time drift logger via Skyfield

Expand Observer model to include memory decay/resonance

API endpoint for New Year sidereal markers (Mintaka / Betelgeuse)

Integration with Scalar Soul: sound, ethics, and AI models
