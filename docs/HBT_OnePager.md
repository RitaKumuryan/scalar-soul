# 📄 HBT One-Pager: Scientific Summary

**Haykyan Boon Tomar (HBT)** is a sidereal-solar calendar system rooted in ancient Armenian cosmology, reconceived for modern scientific application. Unlike linear models that require artificial leap year adjustments, HBT integrates sidereal drift naturally through a spiral time constant and astronomical alignments.

## 🔹 Key Properties

- **System Type:** Sidereal-Solar Spiral Calendar  
- **Origin:** Armenian Cosmology (Hayk–Orion axis)  
- **Control Stars:** Mintaka (δ Orionis), Betelgeuse (α Orionis)  
- **Spiral Constant:** 1.01666667 = 366 ÷ 360  
- **Earth Anchor:** Tatev Monastery (Azimuth: 67.5°)  
- **Correction Phase:** Avelyats (6 days, Aug 5–11)

## 📌 Core Concepts

### Spiral Time:
Time is measured not in repeating cycles but as an **ascending spiral**, with drift accounted for using stellar movement, not artificial insertions.

### Mintaka as Anchor:
- **New Year:** August 11, 04:00 AM (Azimuth 98°)  
- **Zero Hour:** August 5, 04:24 AM → 360th rising  
- **Sidereal Year:** 360 days  
- **Solar Year:** 365.2 days  
- **Correction:** No leap year; Avelyats absorbs drift naturally

## 🕯 Role of the Observer
HBT uniquely positions the observer (human consciousness) as the closing phase in time calibration. Synchronization is not complete until place, time, and presence converge.

> "Consciousness harmonizes the spiral. Presence completes the rhythm."

## 🗺 Tatev and the Gavazan Column
The sidereal calendar is physically anchored at **Tatev Monastery**, aligned with both solar and stellar events:
- August 5, 06:00 AM: Sunrise at azimuth 67.5° (Tatev’s axis)  
- Mintaka rises directly above the **Gavazan** (column marking 360°)

## 📅 Calendar Structure
| Type         | Duration          | Function                  |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Sidereal Year| 360 days          | Stellar rotation cycle    |
| Solar Year   | 365.2 days        | Sun-based seasonal cycle  |
| Avelyats     | 6 days            | Drift restoration phase   |

## 🌱 Philosophical Insight
HBT asserts that **time is a memory spiral** — not a loop. Each return to Mintaka is not a repetition, but an elevation of conscious alignment with the cosmos.

> “To walk the spiral of Hayk is to remember in motion.”
