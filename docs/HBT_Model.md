# 📘 Haykyan Boon Tomar (HBT) — Full Model

The Haykyan Boon Tomar (HBT) system presents a sidereal-solar calendar model based on the celestial mechanics of Orion (Hayk), integrating cosmic drift into a spiral framework of time. Below is the full scientific and symbolic structure of the model.

---

## 1. Presentation of the Haykyan System

HBT offers an alternative framework for measuring time using sidereal (stellar) cycles. It eliminates the need for leap years by encoding sidereal drift into a spiraling process, not a linear one. The model emerged from 20+ years of comparative research in calendar systems, fieldwork, and biospheric feedback.

## 2. The Spiral View of Time

Time is not a straight succession of events but a spiral of interlinked cycles, calibrated through stellar and solar observations. This allows natural synchronization and resets without external correction.

> "Time does not repeat; it spirals upward."

---

## 3. Orion (Hayk) as Anchor

In Armenian cosmology, Hayk = Orion. He is both mythic ancestor and celestial axis. Orion is not symbolic — it is the *mechanism* for timekeeping.

- **Mintaka** (δ Orionis) = Sidereal Start
- **Betelgeuse** (α Orionis) = Reset Marker
- **Azimuthal alignment** = Anchors at Tatev Monastery

---

## 4. Key Terms

- **HBT**: Haykyan Boon Tomar (“Original Calendar of Hayk”)
- **Sidereal**: Star-based cycles
- **Solar**: Sun-based cycles
- **Spiral Constant**: 1.01666667 (366 / 360)

---

## 5. Celestial & Geographic Anchors

### Primary Stars
- **Mintaka** — Aug 11, 04:00 AM — Azimuth: 98°
- **Betelgeuse** — Aug 5, 04:00 AM — Azimuth: 90°

### Earth Anchor
- **Tatev Monastery**
  - Latitude: 39.38° N
  - Longitude: 46.26° E
  - Azimuth: 67.5° (Sunrise on Aug 5, 06:00 AM)

---

## 6. Mintaka & the Spiral Constant

Mintaka rises ~4 minutes earlier daily → 4 min × 360 = 24 hours = 1 sidereal day gain. Thus:

- **Sidereal year** = 360 days
- **Solar year** = 365.2 days
- **Mintaka rises** = 366 times/year
- **Spiral Constant** = 1.01666667

This constant also appears in harmonic acoustics:
- 441 Hz × 1.01666667 = 448.35 Hz
- 441 Hz ÷ 1.01666667 ≈ 433.77 Hz

## 7. Tatev & the Gavazan

- Gavazan = 8.3m column with 12 octagonal segments
- Aligns with Mintaka on:
  - Aug 5, 04:24 AM (Zero Hour)
  - Aug 11, 04:00 AM (New Year)
- Symbolizes 360°, spiral memory, and sidereal reset

Tatev is also located on a biospheric energy node:
- No Hartmann grid interference
- High emotional and physical well-being reported

## 8. Observer Role

The HBT model integrates **human consciousness** as the final synchronizing element:

> "Consciousness harmonizes the spiral. Presence completes the rhythm."

### Triadic Alignment:
1. Earth (Position)
2. Cosmos (Star & Sun coordinates)
3. Observer (Awareness)

*Figure: Earth, Heavens, and Observer form the scalar synchronization loop.*

> **Note:** “Heavens” refers to the sidereal celestial sphere — the dynamic stellar and solar field used for synchronization. Equivalent to “sky” in empirical astronomy, it retains symbolic meaning tied to Orion (Hayk), cosmic rhythm, and observer-based resonance.

## 9. Calendar Structure

- 12 months × 30 sidereal days = **360 sidereal days**
- 6-day Avelyats phase = spiral correction zone

### Drift Chart Summary:
| Month | Start Date     | Sidereal Days | Cumulative Drift |
|-------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1     | Aug 11, 04:00  | 30             | 1h 58m           |
| 2     | Sep 10, 02:02  | 30             | 3h 56m           |
| 3     | Oct 10, 00:04  | 30             | 5h 54m           |
| ...   | ...            | ...            | ...              |
| 12    | Jul 6, 06:22   | 30             | 23h 36m          |
| Avelyats | Aug 5–11    | 6              | 24h 00m          |

## 10. Avelyats — Time Outside Time

- **Begins**: Aug 5, 04:24 AM → Mintaka's 360th rise
- **Ends**: Aug 11, 04:00 AM → Mintaka begins again
- **Sunrise**: Aug 5, 06:00 AM at azimuth 67.5° (Tatev axis)
- A natural 6-day phase to restore drift, no leap year needed

---

## 11. Navasard — The New Spiral

- **Navasard = “New Opening”** (Aug 11, 04:00 AM)
- Mintaka rises at same azimuth/RA as previous year
- Not a reset — an elevation

> Time is a spiral breath: inhale (Avelyats), exhale (Sidereal Year)

---

## 12. Conclusion

HBT offers a living time model that unites:
- Celestial mechanics
- Spiral mathematics
- Observer consciousness

It bridges ancient memory with modern physics.

**"To inhabit time is to awaken it."**
