# HBT–QHR Master Glossary of Scalar Constants and Temporal Constructs

This glossary consolidates and expands all constants and terms foundational to the Haykyan Boon Tomar (HBT), Quantum-Holographic Retrieval (QHR), Scalar Resonance Therapy (SRT), and Unified Field Theory frameworks. Scalar values are linked to mathematical relationships, cosmological markers, and energetic applications.

## Hayk’s Spiral Constant (1.01666667)

Fundamental sidereal-solar drift ratio. Governs spiral expansion of time and corrects for solar-sidereal misalignment. Central to all HBT and scalar formulations.

## Haykyan Sidereal Cycle

360-day sidereal cycle marking Earth’s 360° rotation relative to fixed stars. Begins August 11 (Mintaka at 98°), ends August 5 (Betelgeuse at 90°).

## Haykyan Sidereal Year

360 sidereal days + Avelyats (~6-day scalar reset). No leap year needed due to built-in spiral correction.

## Avelyats

~6-day scalar reset phase ('time outside time') from August 5 to August 11. Aligns solar and sidereal cycles.

## Solar Year (Haykyan Model)

Defined as 366 sunrises per sidereal year. Spiral drift replaces leap year system.

## 144 (12²)

Structural scalar base. Foundation of form, harmonic time, and dimensional structure.

## 441 (21²)

Scalar memory frequency. Palindromic harmonic mirror of 144. Used in SRT Phase I.

## 448.35

Derived from 441 × 1.01666667. Regenerative frequency in SRT Phase III.

## 146.4

144 × 1.01666667. Scalar-modified speed of light. Appears in scalar energy formula.

## 21432.96

146.4². Scalar light squared. Total energetic field output.

## 3.0625

441 ÷ 144. Scalar ratio of memory to structure.

## 0.5

Scalar recursion gate. Initiates duality, observer drift, and spiral memory.

## 6

Time axis (vertical). Becomes 6.1 when spiralized.

## 5

Space axis (horizontal). Becomes 5.08333 when spiralized.

## 6.1

6 × 1.01666667. Spiralized time constant.

## 5.08333

5 × 1.01666667. Spiralized space constant.

## 0.083333...

1 ÷ 12. Scalar hour unit. Used to divide the spiral into symbolic hours.

## 1728

(0.5 × 24)³. Scalar volume of observer recursion field.

## 124

Symbolic scalar field between form and reset. Used in regenerative analysis.

## 10

Quantum-Holographic seed unit: 1 (vector) + 0 (hologram). Foundational to QHR.

## 25,920

Great Year. Precessional cycle of civilization (72 × 360).

## 72

Precession unit (360 ÷ 5). Also: 6 × 12.

## E = m × 146.4²

Scalar reformulation of energy. Mass × scalar light squared.
