This folder contains the master glossary for all scalar constants, phase values, and symbolic references used in the HBT–QHR framework. It supports sidereal synchronization, resonance theory, scalar physics, and temporal recursion.

## Included Files
- `HBT_QHR_Master_Glossary.md`: Primary glossary of all scalar constants and interdependent terms.
- `Scalar_Axial_Cross_Hayks_Constant.md`: Visual and theoretical explanation of the axial cross and spiral transformation.
- Future additions may include additional diagrams and multilingual versions.
