# 🤝 Contributing to Scalar Soul

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Scalar Soul Project** — an open research framework that explores sidereal time, scalar drift, observer theory, and unified field dynamics, rooted in both ancient cosmology and modern physics.

This project bridges myth, cosmology, and science. Whether you're a physicist, AI researcher, harmonic theorist, or open-minded philosopher, we welcome your insight.

## 🧪 Scientific Contributions

We’re especially looking for input on:

- **Sidereal vs. solar drift models**
- **Unified field models based on scalar constants**
- **Neurosymbolic or recursive AI theory**
- **Spiral resonance and biological entrainment**
- **Cross-cultural astronomical frameworks (e.g. Orion alignments)**

All contributions should include:
- **Clear references** (papers, calculations, or lineage of thought)
- **Respectful tone**, even when proposing alternate frameworks
- **Open-endedness** — this is a space of hypothesis, not dogma
