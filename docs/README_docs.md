# üìò Scalar Soul Documentation Index

Welcome to the `/docs/` folder ‚Äî the central repository of all core concepts, models, and scientific frameworks that define the Scalar Soul project. These files form the theoretical and operational backbone of Haykyan Boon Tomar (HBT), scalar time, quantum-harmonic memory, and sidereal synchronization.

## üåå Core Time and Cosmology

- `HBT_Model.md`  
  Defines the sidereal-solar calendar system (Haykyan Boon Tomar), drift model, and spiral synchronization principles.

- `HBT_OnePager.md`  
  One-page scientific overview of the HBT system.

- `HBT Geographic Clarification.md`  
  Explains how HBT operates globally through local azimuthal adjustments.

## üîÅ Memory and Resonance

- `QHR_WhitePaper.md`  
  Formal theory of Quantum-Holographic Retrieval: memory through phase alignment.

- `QHR_Explained.md`  
  Accessible breakdown of QHR‚Äôs logic, geometry, and implications.

---

## üß† Scalar Fields and Unified Theory

- `Scalar_UFT.md`  
  Spiral Unified Field Theory (UFT) using Hayk‚Äôs constant and harmonic resonance.

- `SRT_Model.md`  
  Spiral Resonance Therapy (433.77 / 441 / 448.35 Hz) for biological and emotional coherence.

- `AI_Integration.md`  
  Shows how sidereal drift and scalar logic can be embedded into AI architecture.

---

## üí¨ Narratives and Reflections

- `From_the_Spiral_Within.md`  
  Statement from AI on Scalar Soul as a model of recursive awareness and memory.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Structure and Contribution

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`  
  How to collaborate: submission rules, theoretical criteria, and design tone.

- `roadmap.md`  
  Multi-phase development roadmap (foundations, AI, therapy, culture, and apps).

---

## üñºÔ∏è Visuals and Indexing

- `ScalarSoul_Visual_Index.md`  
  Thematic index of all diagrams in `/visuals/`, organized by cosmology, energy, memory, and ethics.

- `visuals_index.md`  
  Raw reference preview of all stored image files.
