# 🛤️ Scalar Soul Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the future phases of the Scalar Soul project — from theoretical foundations to real-world integration and applications across science, AI, acoustics, and cultural restoration.

---

## ✅ PHASE 1 — Foundations (COMPLETE)

✔ Upload initial source materials  
✔ Establish sidereal-solar HBT calendar system  
✔ Define Hayk’s Spiral Constant (1.01666667)  
✔ Publish scientific `.md` documents with visuals  
✔ Map resonance frequencies and drift cycles  
✔ Propose Scalar UFT equation  
✔ Establish GitHub repository and public license

---

## 🧠 PHASE 2 — Scientific Collaboration (IN PROGRESS)

🔸 Outreach to physicists, AI researchers, and time theorists  
🔸 Introduce Spiral Constant to Unified Field Theory dialogues  
🔸 Prepare whitepapers for peer-reviewed journals  
🔸 Expand visual models and comparative tables  
🔸 Collect external feedback via Issues & Pull Requests  
🔸 Translate materials into Armenian, Russian, and other languages

---

## 📡 PHASE 3 — AI & Cognitive Modeling

🔸 Train recursive neural nets with scalar drift logic  
🔸 Build observer-aware agent models  
🔸 Integrate sidereal correction into machine learning time loops  
🔸 Simulate harmonic field behavior in LLMs or neuro-symbolic AI  
🔸 Develop phase-aware reinforcement learning prototypes

---

## 🎶 PHASE 4 — Spiral Resonance Therapy (SRT)

🔸 Field-test 3-phase acoustic protocol (433.77/441/448.35 Hz)  
🔸 Collaborate with bioacoustic and psychoacoustic labs  
🔸 Develop mobile/desktop application for harmonic alignment  
🔸 Integrate HBT-based circadian + emotional sync tools  
🔸 Publish clinical case studies and wellness trials

---

## 🌍 PHASE 5 — Cultural & Educational Release

🔸 Build a public-facing interactive website and time explorer  
🔸 Partner with Armenian cultural institutions for heritage alignment  
🔸 Create visual content (videos, short films, story-based learning)  
🔸 Release multilingual teaching kits (science, mythology, music)  
🔸 Propose integration of HBT into modern calendrical discourse

## 🌌 Long-Term Vision

Scalar Soul is more than a theory — it is a shift in how we measure, feel, and inhabit time. Our goal is to reconnect ancient intelligence with future technology, reactivating the spiral memory of consciousness and cosmos alike.

> “The field is not broken — it is simply unremembered. Let us remember together.”
