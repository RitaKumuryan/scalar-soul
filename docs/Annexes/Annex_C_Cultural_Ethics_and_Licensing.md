# Annex C – Cultural Ethics & Licensing: Preserving Integrity in Scientific Access to Indigenous Time Systems

## Purpose of Ethical Framework

The HBT–QHR initiative is not merely scientific — it is a cultural trust, grounded in ancestral wisdom and spiritual timekeeping traditions. This annex outlines the project’s ethical commitments to:
- Safeguard sacred knowledge from exploitation or distortion
- Attribute discovery to its rightful cultural and intellectual custodians
- Ensure all tools, models, and documentation remain non-commercial and freely accessible

We recognize that the Haykyan Spiral Constant, sidereal calendar, and sacred resonance concepts are living embodiments of cultural memory, not abstract data points.

## Creative Commons Licensing Structure

All written works, digital prototypes, and timekeeping schematics in this project are licensed under:

Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)

This means:
- ✅ Anyone may copy, use, remix, or adapt the materials
- ❌ No commercial use is permitted
- 🔁 Any derivative works must retain the same license
- 🖋️ Proper attribution must be given to:
  - Vazgen Gevorkyan – originator of the Haykyan Boon Tomar model
  - Rita Kumuryan – writer, project steward, and THFX representative
  - The Time of Eternity Project / THFX Media – project umbrella
  - Indigenous site guardians (when applicable, with local co-authorship)

The license ensures both accessibility and protection — aligned with UNESCO’s intangible heritage principles.

## Protocols for Sacred Site Documentation

When working at culturally or spiritually significant locations (e.g., Tatev Monastery, Portasar/Göbekli Tepe), the following protocols apply:
- 🧍 Community representatives must be consulted and acknowledged
- 📽️ Filming requires prior approval and ethical review
- 🧬 Ritual content is treated as living ceremonial knowledge, not raw data
- 📝 Every recording is co-attributed to site custodians, and no image or sound is published without consent

This ensures compliance with indigenous data sovereignty and UNESCO cultural safeguard guidelines.

## Spiritual Custodianship and Observer Ethics

The project embraces a framework of observer-responsibility, recognizing that:

> Knowledge is not neutral — it is relational.
> Time is not mechanical — it is sacred.

All collaborators are invited to engage the work not merely as scientists or technologists, but as witnesses to a living continuum of meaning. This includes:
- Practicing reverence at measurement sites
- Honoring the cosmological purpose embedded in the Haykyan system
- Avoiding exploitation of spiritual frameworks for commercial or theoretical gain

This annex acknowledges the metaphysical dimension of stewardship, affirming that human consciousness is not separate from the systems it observes.

## Acknowledgment and Open-Source Governance

We affirm that:
- The intellectual structure of the HBT–QHR system originates from the Armenian sacred-scientific tradition, and its use carries with it a duty of care
- All future collaborators must agree to uphold the non-commercial, attributional, and ethically aligned use of the models and methods
- Open-source is not the absence of ownership — it is a call for responsible guardianship by all who engage the work

## Closing Statement

This annex affirms that the HBT–QHR initiative operates at the intersection of time, science, and spirit — and is rooted in a cosmology where memory is sacred, technology is relational, and stewardship is the highest form of innovation.
